  <h4>overview of the process: </h4>
  <h5>
    1. When a property reference to an object is made, first the object itself is checked to see <em>if the property exists</em>. If it does, the value is taken. If not...<br>
    2. The <em>prototype associated</em> with the object is located and it is checked for the property. If it exists, the value is take. If not...<br>
    3. The value is <em>undefined</em>.<br>
  </h5>
    <p>
    <h5>
      even when the prototyped method is added after the instance method has been added, that the <em>instance method takes precedence</em>.<br>
      This makes perfect sense. The <em>prototype is only consulted when a property reference on the object itself fails</em>.<br>
      As the object possesses a swingSword property, the prototyped version doesnâ€™t come into play, even though it was added to the prototype after object construction.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      NOTE While the <em>constructor property of an object can be changed</em>,<br>
      doing so doesn't have any immediate or obvious purpose as its reason for being is to inform as to where the object was constructed from.<br>
     <em>The original value will simply be overwritten and lost</em>.<br>
