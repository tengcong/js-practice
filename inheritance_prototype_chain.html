    The best technique capable of creating such a prototype chain is by using an instance of an object as the other object’s prototype as in:<br>
    <em>SubClass.prototype = new SuperClass();</em><br>
    This will preserve the prototype chain as the prototype of the SubClass instance will be an instance of the SuperClass,<br>
    which has a prototype with all the properties of SuperClass, and which will in turn have a prototype pointing to an instance of its superclass, and on and on.<br>
    Make sure not to use the <em>Ninja.prototype = Person.prototype;</em>technique. <br>
    When doing this, any changes to the Ninja prototype will also change the Person prototype (since they're the same object) – which is bound to have undesirable side effects.

  // best practice
  Ninja.prototype = new Person();

  assert(nin instanceof Ninja, 'nin is Ninja');
  assert(typeof nin.dance == 'function', 'nin can dance');
