  <h1>It is about "Arguments" and "This"</h1>
  <h4>If more arguments are supplied than there are parameters, the “excess” arguments are simply not assigned to parameter names.<br>
    We’ll see in just a bit that even though the arguments aren’t assigned to parameter names, we still have a way to get at them.</h4>
  <h4>If there are more parameters than there are arguments, the parameters that have no corresponding argument are set to undefined.</h4>
  <h4>And, very interestingly, all function invocations are also passed two implicit parameters: arguments and this.</h4>
  <h4>And as it turns out, what the this parameter points to is not, as in Java, defined by how the function is declared, but by how it is invoked!</h4>

  <h5>There are actually four different ways to invoke a function, each with their own nuances. They are:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>As a <em>function</em>, in which the function is invoked in a straightforward manner.</li>
    <li>As a <em>method</em>, which ties the invocation to an object, enabling object-oriented programming.</li>
    <li>As a <em>constructor</em>, in which a new object is brought into being.</li>
    <li>Via <em>their apply() or call() methods</em>, which, well, is kind of complicated, so we’ll take that when we get to it.</li>
  </ul>
